* **For me important** good team relations and interesting job.
  I feel the need for a new professional experience. I'm really interested in Java and Kotlin programming.
  I seem these languages very promising, especially Kotlin. I like to study something new - new technologies, new framework, new ways.
  I am looking for new incentives and new horizons for myself.
  And of course I like it when my knowledge and work are appreciated.
  I think I will be useful to your company. I like working with professionals - they always have a lot to teach.
